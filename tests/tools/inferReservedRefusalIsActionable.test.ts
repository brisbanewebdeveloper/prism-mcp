/**
 * A refusal has to tell the caller what to do next.
 *
 * Observed from a real Codex session:
 *
 *   backend=refused gate=refused:layer1_reserved
 *   attempts=[{"tier":"layer1","reason":"layer1_obvious_reserved"}]
 *
 * The message behind that said only "Layer 1 verdict=OBVIOUS_RESERVED, reserved
 * content refused". Three things a caller needs were missing: which of eleven
 * rules fired, whether it was clinical or operational, and that escalation
 * exists at all.
 *
 * The gap matters most in the configuration that produces it. allowCloud is
 * `args.cloud_fallback === true && ent.features.cloud_fallback`, and hosts
 * following the local-first instruction pass cloud_fallback: false. Reserved
 * content is never answered locally, so that pairing can only ever refuse — the
 * absence of a synalux entry in the attempts trace above is the proof that cloud
 * was never even tried. Correct, but a dead end unless the refusal says so.
