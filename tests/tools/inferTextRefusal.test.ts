/**
 * A Layer 1 refusal must never be reported as "no local answer".
 *
 * Callers of the old `callLocalLlm` helper treated null as unavailability and
 * responded by trying the cloud — compactionHandler does exactly that, on
 * ledger content, three lines after the local attempt. When inferText caught
 * every throw into null, a reserved-content refusal became indistinguishable
 * from "Ollama is down", so the classifier's refusal was the trigger for the
 * cloud disclosure it exists to prevent.
 *
 * That is a fail-open in a reserved category, and it was introduced by routing
 * these callers through the ladder — before, there was no Layer 1 at all, so
 * there was no refusal to lose. Adding screening whose "no" is discarded is
 * worse than no screening, because it reads as protection.
