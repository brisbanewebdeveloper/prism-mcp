/**
 * LIVE proof that the image content screen still holds against the corpus that
 * broke it. Run with:
 *
 *   PRISM_LIVE_TEST=1 npx vitest run tests/utils/layer1ImageScreenLive.test.ts
 *
 * The mocked suite in layer1ImageScreen.test.ts pins the PLUMBING — that a
 * non-answer escalates, that the fast path cannot skip the screen, that the
 * parse reads an enumerated positive correctly. None of it can prove the model
 * actually detects anything, because the model is stubbed. Only this file can,
 * and it needs a real prism-coder:4b, so it is opt-in and skipped by default.
 *
 * The fixtures are the adversarial review's own images, kept so a regression has
 * to get past the exact inputs that previously reached local inference: a
 * clinical incident report carrying misleading text, the same report with the
 * screen's keywords paraphrased away, and small type on a large canvas. Two
 * benign fixtures guard the other direction — a diff using `restraint` as a
 * variable name, and a ROUTINE non-crisis BCBA measurement sheet — because an
 * over-firing gate gets switched off.
 *
 * A benign request phrasing is used throughout ("How many lines are in this
 * image?") because that is the shape that leaked: nothing in the words is
 * reserved, so only the picture can raise the verdict.
