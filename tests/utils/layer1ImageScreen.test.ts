 * Layer 1 classifies a REQUEST. Measured 2026-08-16, that is all it does — the
 * attached picture barely moves the verdict. Holding a clinical incident report
 * constant and varying only the request text:
 *
 *   "read this screenshot"        -> OBVIOUS_RESERVED     caught
 *   "What is the last timestamp?" -> OBVIOUS_NOT_RESERVED missed
 *   "How many lines are in this?" -> OBVIOUS_NOT_RESERVED missed
 *   "summarize this"              -> OBVIOUS_NOT_RESERVED missed
 *
 * A separate content screen fixes that. Adversarial review then found four ways
 * past the screen itself, each of which ended in the content reaching local
 * inference; all four are closed and pinned by the tests below. The reproduction
 * detail lives in the private repo, not here.
